## Purpose

The Vulnerability Management Maturity Model (VMMM) is an open, reference-based maturity model intended to support the understanding and improvement of vulnerability management practices across organizations and industries.

This license is designed to encourage broad, frictionless adoption and reference of VMMM while preventing rebranding, resale, or enclosure of the model itself.
