# VMMM
**Vulnerability Management Maturity Model (VMMM)**

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the **Vulnerability Management Maturity Model (VMMM)** ‚Äî a structured framework to help organizations assess, develop, and optimize their vulnerability management programs.

The VMMM provides a practical way to measure maturity across the end-to-end vulnerability management lifecycle, covering **Prepare, Identify, Analyze, Communicate, and Treat** phases. The model was designed to support organizations of all sizes in building programs that are risk-aligned, governance-backed, and capable of reducing vulnerabilities at scale.

## üìå What Is the VMMM?

The Vulnerability Management Maturity Model (VMMM) is a **capability-based assessment tool** for measuring the maturity of a vulnerability management program. It helps organizations:

- Identify gaps in governance, process, integration, and automation
- Prioritize foundational activities before advancing to more complex capabilities
- Build a roadmap toward risk-driven, optimized vulnerability management
- Align program priorities with business needs, compliance requirements, and threat realities

The VMMM maps maturity across five levels (1‚Äì5), while also grouping domains into **Foundational, Enhanced, and Strategic** categories to help organizations focus on the right capabilities at the right time.

## üß≠ How to Use the VMMM

1. **Review the Domains and Levels**  
   Explore `VMMM.xlsx` to understand the maturity model structure across the five phases and all domains.

2. **Use the Companion Guide**  
   Refer to `VMMM Companion Guide.pdf` for detailed descriptions of each domain ‚Äî ideal for stakeholder alignment and assessor training.

3. **Map Your Maturity**  
   Score each domain from Level 1 to 5 using the model and examples to guide consistent interpretation.

4. **Apply Use Cases and Examples**  
   Use `Examples and Use Cases for the VMMM` to see how maturity looks in real-world scenarios. This helps with validation, internal communications, and program planning.

5. **Prioritize by Classification**  
   Focus on **Foundational** domains first, then advance to **Enhanced** and **Strategic** capabilities over time.
