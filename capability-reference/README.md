# VMMM v2 — Capability Mappings & Interpretive Artifacts

This directory contains **capability-level interpretive artifacts** that support the application, assessment, and communication of the Vulnerability Management Maturity Model (VMMM v2).

These materials are designed to help organizations **translate maturity concepts into familiar governance, audit, and decision-making contexts** without reducing maturity to a checklist or control inventory.

They are intentionally non-prescriptive and must be read in conjunction with the VMMM v2 Canon.

---

## What Lives in This Directory

For each VMMM capability, this directory may contain **three complementary artifacts**:

### 1. Capability Cards
One-page executive-oriented summaries designed to:
- Communicate *why the capability matters*
- Highlight *what breaks when it is absent*
- Provide a quick maturity orientation
- Support leadership conversations and prioritization

Cards are not assessments and are not intended to replace the Canon or Guides.

---

### 2. Capability Guides
Interpretive guidance that explains:
- Why the capability exists
- What maturity looks like over time
- Common failure modes and anti-patterns
- How the capability supports decision quality and governance

Guides are **explanatory**, not instructional.  
They describe *what mature behavior looks like*, not *how to implement it*.

---

### 3. Capability Mappings
Framework alignment documents that:
- Map VMMM capability behaviors to the *intent* of external frameworks
- Provide traceability for audit, regulatory, and assurance discussions
- Clarify evidence types commonly associated with mature behavior

Mappings operate at the **outcome and decision level**, not at the control-by-control level.

---

## What These Artifacts Are For

Collectively, the materials in this directory support:

- Maturity assessments and interpretation
- Executive and board-level briefings
- Audit and regulatory translation
- Program design and governance discussions
- Avoiding false signals of maturity

They are especially useful when organizations must explain **why decisions were made**, not just **what actions were taken**.

---

## What These Artifacts Are Not

These materials are **not**:

- Implementation guides
- Configuration instructions
- Tool comparisons or recommendations
- Control checklists
- Compliance certifications
- Audit evidence packages

Alignment to a framework does **not** imply compliance, certification, or audit readiness.

Frameworks evolve independently, and organizations remain responsible for their own interpretations and obligations.

---

## Structure of This Directory

Artifacts are organized by **VMMM phase** to reflect how maturity is assessed and governed in practice:
capability-reference/
├── prepare/
├── identify/
├── analyze/
├── communicate/
└── treat/

Each phase directory contains multiple capabilities.  
For each capability, you will typically find:

- A Card (executive orientation)
- A Guide (interpretive depth)
- A Mapping (framework alignment)

Not all artifacts are intended for the same audience or use case.

---

## Relationship to the VMMM Canon

The **VMMM v2 Canon** remains the authoritative source for:
- Definitions
- Scope
- Maturity interpretation
- Domain structure
- Assessment logic

The materials in this directory **extend and support** the canon; they do not redefine it.

If there is any conflict between a mapping, guide, or card and the canon, **the canon takes precedence**.

---

## Interpretation Guidance

These artifacts should be used to:
- Support consistent interpretation of maturity
- Reduce misalignment between activity, metrics, and decision quality
- Prevent tool-centric or compliance-driven misuse of the model

They should **never** be used in isolation to assert maturity claims.

Maturity must always be interpreted:
- Across domains
- Over time
- With attention to decision authority and governance

---

## Versioning and Evolution

These materials may evolve independently of the canon to:
- Reflect updates to external frameworks
- Improve clarity and articulation
- Incorporate community feedback

Updates here do not imply changes to VMMM capability definitions unless explicitly stated.

## Use and Attribution

Use of these materials is governed by the VMMM license.

When referencing these artifacts publicly or internally, attribution to:
