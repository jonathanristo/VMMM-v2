# How You Can Use This

The VMMM™ is free to use for internal security assessments, maturity planning, and client advisory work—as long as you give proper credit and don’t resell or repackage it.

You’re welcome to suggest improvements, translate it, or tailor it for your industry, as long as you don’t claim it’s official or use it in commercial tools, courses, or platforms without permission.

We want this model to help the community—not become someone else’s product. If in doubt, just reach out: **license@zenzizensec.com**
