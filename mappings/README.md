# Framework Mappings

This directory contains interpretive mappings between the Vulnerability Management Maturity Model (VMMM) and commonly referenced security and risk frameworks, including but not limited to:

- NIST SP 800-53
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- CIS Critical Security Controls
- ISO/IEC 27001 and 27002

These mappings are provided to support understanding, adoption, and contextual alignment of VMMM within organizations that operate under established regulatory, compliance, or assurance expectations.

---

## Purpose of These Mappings

The intent of these mappings is to:

- Illustrate how VMMM capabilities and maturity behaviors align with the *intent* of widely adopted frameworks
- Provide a translation layer between maturity-based reasoning and control-oriented frameworks
- Support internal, audit, and regulatory discussions by grounding VMMM concepts in familiar reference material

These mappings are not intended to replace, supersede, or redefine any external framework.

---

## How to Use These Mappings

Each mapping document focuses on a single VMMM capability and:

- Describes how maturity in that capability manifests across levels
- Identifies exemplar controls or outcomes from external frameworks that relate to those maturity behaviors
- Explains the relationship at a conceptual and outcome level, not as a prescriptive checklist

Readers should treat these documents as **reference material**, consulting sections relevant to their context rather than reading end-to-end.

---

## Important Boundaries and Limitations

These mappings are intentionally **illustrative, not exhaustive**.

Specifically:

- They do **not** provide control-by-control equivalence
- They do **not** assert compliance, certification, or audit readiness
- They do **not** imply that achieving a maturity level satisfies any specific regulatory requirement
- They do **not** replace formal compliance assessments or audits

Frameworks evolve independently, and organizations remain responsible for their own interpretations and compliance obligations.

---

## Structure of This Directory

Mappings are organized by VMMM domain to reflect how capabilities are grouped and assessed in practice.

Each domain directory contains:

- One or more capability-specific mapping documents
- Optional domain-level context explaining how the capabilities are typically reviewed or evaluated

This structure is intentional and mirrors how maturity assessments and governance reviews are conducted.

---

## Relationship to the Canonical Model

These mappings are **supporting reference artifacts**.

They are designed to complement, not redefine, the canonical VMMM v2 documents located in the `/canon` directory.

Where definitions, terminology, or scope questions arise, the canonical model should be treated as the authoritative source.

---

## Versioning and Stability

Mappings may be updated independently of the canonical model to reflect:

- Framework revisions
- Clarifications in interpretation
- Improved articulation of relationships

Updates to mappings do not imply changes to the underlying VMMM capability definitions unless explicitly stated.

## Use and Attribution

Use of these mappings is permitted under the VMMM license terms.

When referencing these materials, attribution to VMMM and the applicable version is required.
